This is a cloud-based file storage tool which allows users to store their files and retrieve them at any time.

I have written my own web server for it in C, and I'm using my own C++ database system that includes my own SQL language for it as well.

Technologies used:

Frontend:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Javascript + jQuery
    - AJAX for reloadless communication between user's browser and the web server.

Backend:
    - C (for web server from scratch)
    - C++ + wxWidgets (for database system w/ a GUI from scratch)
    - Sockets for local interprocess communications (between server and database) and internet communication (between user's browser and the web server).
